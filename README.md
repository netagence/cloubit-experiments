Experiments with cloudBit from Littlebits
=============
### About
Tests and fun with Littlebits Cloudbit by Arthur (7) and Pierre (his father) from Rennes, France.
We have become fans of https://littlebits.cc the great electronic building blocks made for hackers and makers like us both.
This is a test to develop fun code for the Cloudbit, "the easiest way to create internet-connected devices" with those blocks.
I mainly know Linux so those scripts will be in Bash/Shell and PHP, maybe so Python that I dab into.
I have a Web-related job but am not a professional developer, so be forgiving and enter here at your own risks ;-)

Comments and forking welcome, this is made to be shared and improved.
