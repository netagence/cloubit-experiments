Experiments with cloudbit from Littlebits
=============
### About
Tests and fun with Littlebits Cloudbit by Arthur (7) and Pierre (his father) from Rennes, France.
We have become fans of https://littlebits.cc the great electronic building blocks made for hackers and makers like us both.
This is a test to develop fun code for the Cloudbit, "the easiest way to create internet-connected devices" with those blocks.
I am not a developer and mainly know Linux so those scripts will be in Bash/Shell and PHP, and you enter here at your own risks ;-)
Comments and forking welcome, this is made to be shared and improved.
